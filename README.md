# PosseNetAPIApp

This is part of a college project and is not meant for live-production

Using C# and the .NET framework, this is a server backend for my 4th year project.
This source code outlines all of the various API calls available to the Android application also in development.
Because all data returned is in JSON/XML format, this project is easily portable to all platforms.

A JWT is required when using most of the APIs available, which can be generated by signing in (submitting details to Azure SQL DB)
